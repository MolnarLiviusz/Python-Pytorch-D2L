# Python-Pytorch-D2L
Learning files

In these I'm utulising Python, Pytorch and D2L ( http://d2l.ai ) to implement and learn ML and DL. Currently I understand the math behind it, I am able to implement Linear Neural Networks with Linear Regression, and Softmax Regression. Right now I'm deep into familiarising myself with Multilayer Perceptrons and I understand the importance and differences between activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid and tanh.
